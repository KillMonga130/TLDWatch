ICON CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

To create the required icon files for the Chrome extension:

METHOD 1 - Quick Online Tool:
1. Go to https://www.favicon.cc/
2. Draw a simple "AI" text or learning symbol
3. Download as PNG
4. Rename to icon16.png
5. Use an image editor to resize copies to 48x48 and 128x128
6. Save as icon48.png and icon128.png

METHOD 2 - Use the HTML Generator:
1. Open create-icons.html in your browser
2. It will automatically download 3 PNG files
3. Move them to the icons/ folder

METHOD 3 - Manual Creation:
Create 3 PNG files with these specifications:
- icon16.png: 16x16 pixels
- icon48.png: 48x48 pixels  
- icon128.png: 128x128 pixels

All should have:
- Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- White "AI" text or learning symbol
- Transparent or solid background

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
The extension will load with warnings about missing icons, but will still function.
You can ignore the icon warnings during development and add proper icons later.

FILES NEEDED:
- icons/icon16.png
- icons/icon48.png
- icons/icon128.png
